01/05/2023 - Got to working on the design, nothing much so far code wise.

07/05/2023 - Got MainActivity and MovieStruct Done, work is coming up this week,
                So I hope I have time to work on it bit by bit.

12/05/2023 - Nope I didn't, I couldn't work on it at all since I was up for 4 days + nights.
                I am gonna have to start working on this on Sunday instead.

14/05/2023 - Started working on this again, Watchlist is added and I was able to get Movie Adapter working.
                Had to lookup some ways to structure the Adapter, but I think it will work fine.
                Still need to get the Details working on get this thing on github.

15/05/2023 - Gonna go ahead and push this to github so I can get a link, details I'll get to working on
